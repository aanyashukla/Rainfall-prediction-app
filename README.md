# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction App

A web-based machine learning app that predicts whether it will rain today based on user-provided weather conditions.
Built using **Random Forest**, **Streamlit**, and **Plotly** for interactive data input and output visualization.

## 🧠 How the App Works
- You enter weather parameters on the left sidebar.
- The app visualizes your input in a bar chart.
- When you click 🔍 Predict, it:
    - Loads the trained model
    - Makes a prediction (Yes/No for Rain)
    - Displays prediction confidence as a pie chart
